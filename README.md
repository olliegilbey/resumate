## Philosophy: Human-Written, AI-Curated

> **You create the content. AI selects what's relevant.**

This framework follows [Anthropic's AI guidance principles](https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance):

✅ **All experiences**: Human-written by you
✅ **All selection**: Heuristic-based, or AI-assisted curation
✅ **All content**: Authentic and real
❌ **Never fabricates** career history or achievements

Resumate is **not** an AI resume generator. It's a curation system that helps you present your authentic professional story effectively. You write your bullets once, with all the detail and context. When you need a resume for a specific role, AI helps you select which experiences are most relevant—never generating or fabricating content.

**Compliant with Anthropic's candidate AI guidance.**

## Data Structure

Resumate uses a hierarchical JSON structure:

```json
{
  "personal": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "fullName": "Your Full Name",
    "location": "City, Country",
    "linkedin": "username",
    "github": "username",
    "website": "yourdomain.com"
  },
  "companies": [
    {
      "name": "Company Name",
      "positions": [
        {
          "role": "Your Role",
          "description": "What you did (human-written)",
          "bullets": [
            {
              "text": "Achievement or responsibility (human-written)",
              "tags": ["developer-relations", "team-leadership"],
              "priority": 9,
              "metrics": "20% increase",
              "link": "https://..."
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

See `data/TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` for complete documentation.

## Code Quality & Review

### CodeRabbit CLI

This project uses [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) for AI-powered code reviews.

**Installation**:
```bash
bun install -g @coderabbit/cli
coderabbit auth
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Review uncommitted changes with context from CLAUDE.md
coderabbit review --plain --type uncommitted --config CLAUDE.md

# Review all files
coderabbit review --plain --type all

# Review specific commit
coderabbit review --plain --type committed
```

**When to run**:
- ✅ Before committing (catch issues early)
- ✅ After major refactors (verify quality)
- ✅ When stuck (get AI suggestions)
- ✅ Regular check-ins (maintain code health)

Claude Code and Warp editors should run this extensively when making changes.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel Setup

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel login
   ```

2. **Link Project**
   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**

   Use `printf` to avoid newline issues:

   ```bash
   # Contact info
   printf "%s" "your@email.com" | vercel env add CONTACT_EMAIL_PROFESSIONAL production
   printf "%s" "personal@email.com" | vercel env add CONTACT_EMAIL_PERSONAL production
   printf "%s" "+1234567890" | vercel env add CONTACT_PHONE production

   # Turnstile keys
   printf "%s" "0x4AAA..." | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY production
   printf "%s" "0x4AAA..." | vercel env add TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY production

   # Gist URL (for build-time data fetch)
   printf "%s" "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/..." | vercel env add RESUME_DATA_GIST_URL production
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### GitHub Actions Auto-Deploy

Set up automatic deploys when your gist is updated:

1. **Create Vercel Deploy Hook**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Git → Deploy Hooks
   - Create hook for `main` branch

2. **Create Vercel API Token**
   - https://vercel.com/account/tokens
   - Scope: your project

3. **Get Project ID**
   ```bash
   vercel project inspect resumate | grep "ID"
   ```

4. **Set GitHub Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Project ID
   printf "%s" "prj_..." | gh secret set VERCEL_PROJECT_ID -R your-username/resumate

   # API Token
   printf "%s" "your_token" | gh secret set VERCEL_TOKEN -R your-username/resumate

   # Deploy Hook URL
   printf "%s" "https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/..." | gh secret set VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL -R your-username/resumate
   ```

The GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/gist-deploy-trigger.yml`) will:
- Run hourly via cron
- Check if gist was updated since last Vercel deployment
- Validate JSON format
- Trigger deploy if changes detected

### Security Checklist
- ✅ Environment variables set in Vercel (no newlines!)
- ✅ `.env.local` is gitignored
- ✅ No secrets in repository
- ✅ Build succeeds: `just build`
- ✅ Turnstile working on production
- ✅ GitHub Action secrets configured

---

## Remote Data Editing with GitHub Gists

Your resume data (`data/resume-data.json`) is **gitignored** for privacy. To edit from anywhere (phone, tablet, any browser), use a **private GitHub Gist** as your remote data source.

### Setup

1. **Create Secret Gist**
   - Go to https://gist.github.com
   - Filename: `resume-data-[yourname].json`
   - Paste your `data/resume-data.json`
   - **Select "Create secret gist"**

2. **Get Raw URL**
   - Click "Raw" button
   - Copy URL: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/[user]/[hash]/raw/resume-data-[yourname].json`

3. **Add to .env.local**
   ```env
   RESUME_DATA_GIST_URL=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/[user]/[hash]/raw/resume-data-[yourname].json
   ```

### Workflow

```bash
just data-pull    # Pull latest from gist to local
just data-push    # Push local changes to gist
just data-view    # View gist content in terminal
```

**Edit from anywhere**: Visit https://gist.github.com/[your-username], find your gist, click "Edit". Changes sync automatically.

**Build-time fetch**: Vercel automatically pulls from gist during builds (via `prebuild` hook).

**Auto-deploy**: GitHub Action checks gist hourly and triggers Vercel deploy when changes detected.

## Documentation System

This project uses a hierarchical documentation system designed to prevent drift and maintain single sources of truth.

### Key Documentation Files

- **[.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md)** - Project router and entry point for AI agents
- **[docs/CURRENT_PHASE.md](docs/CURRENT_PHASE.md)** - Current development phase and status
- **[docs/METRICS.md](docs/METRICS.md)** - Auto-generated test counts and coverage
- **[docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md](docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md)** - TDD philosophy and patterns
- **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design and WASM pipeline
- **[docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Deployment instructions
- **[docs/META_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/META_DOCUMENTATION.md)** - How the documentation system works
- **Linear project** - Active tasks, issues, and milestones

### Documentation Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** - Every fact has exactly one canonical location
2. **Temporal Separation** - Files organized by update frequency (never, quarterly, per phase, daily, per commit)
3. **Auto-Generated Facts** - Test counts and coverage generated from actual test runs
4. **Manual Observations** - Strategic decisions and philosophy documented manually
5. **Automated Verification** - Pre-commit hooks ensure documentation consistency

### Documentation Commands

```bash
just docs-health     # Generate metrics + verify documentation
just docs-verify     # Check documentation consistency
just metrics-generate # Update METRICS.md from test logs
```

**For details:** See [docs/META_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/META_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## AI Philosophy in Practice

### What You Do (Human)
1. ✍️ Write every bullet point yourself
2. 📝 Add context, metrics, links
3. 🏷️ Tag each experience with categories
4. ⭐ Prioritize manually (1-10)

### What AI Does (Curation)
1. 🔍 Helps you find relevant experiences for a role
2. 📊 Suggests which bullets are most applicable
3. 🎯 Organizes content by relevance
4. ✨ Refines presentation (never content)

### What AI NEVER Does
- ❌ Generate bullet points
- ❌ Fabricate achievements
- ❌ Create experiences you haven't had
- ❌ Replace your authentic voice

This distinction is crucial for compliance with Anthropic's guidance and maintaining authenticity in professional representation.
