**Rust:**       140 tests (1 ignored) in 2.09s  ✅ Passing
**TypeScript:** 233 tests in 1.81s  ✅ Passing
**TOTAL:**      373 tests  ✅ All Passing

### Rust Tests (By Crate)

- resume-core:    See log  (scoring, selection, validation)
- resume-typst:   See log  (PDF generation, Typst rendering)
- resume-wasm:    See log  (WASM bindings, JS interop)
- shared-types:   See log  (type validation, schema)

### TypeScript Tests

- Total tests:  233
- Test files:   13
- Execution:    1.81s

**Test files breakdown available in log:** `/Users/olliegilbey/code/resumate/.logs/ts-tests.log`

## Build Artifacts

**WASM Binary:**
- Raw size:     15.08MB  (limit: ≤17MB)   ✅ Pass
- Gzipped size: 6.29MB  (limit: ≤6.5MB)  ✅ Pass

**Limits configured in:** justfile (wasm_max_raw_mb, wasm_max_gzip_mb)
**Enforcement:** Pre-commit hook blocks commits if limits exceeded

## Coverage

### Rust Coverage

**Line Coverage:** 87.54%

**Command to generate detailed report:**
```bash
just coverage-rust        # Generate HTML report
just coverage-rust-open   # Open in browser
```

**Detailed breakdown:** Run `just coverage-rust-open` to view HTML report with per-module coverage

### TypeScript Coverage

**Line Coverage:** Run 'just coverage-ts' to generate

**Breakdown:**
- Overall: See coverage-summary.json
- Per-file: Run `just coverage-ts-open`

**Command to generate detailed report:**
```bash
just coverage-ts          # Generate HTML report
just coverage-ts-open     # Open in browser
```

## Test Execution Details

**Rust Tests:**
- Command: `cargo test --all`
- Log: `/Users/olliegilbey/code/resumate/.logs/rust-tests.log`
- Duration: 2.09s
- Suites: Multiple (core, typst, wasm, shared-types, integration, doc-tests)

**TypeScript Tests:**
- Command: `bun run test --run`
- Log: `/Users/olliegilbey/code/resumate/.logs/ts-tests.log`
- Duration: 1.81s
- Files: 13 test files

---

## Commands

**Run all tests:**
```bash
just test              # Runs tests and updates this file
just test-rust         # Rust only
just test-ts           # TypeScript only
```

**Coverage reports:**
```bash
just coverage          # Generate both Rust + TypeScript
just coverage-rust     # Rust coverage report
just coverage-ts       # TypeScript coverage report
```

**View logs:**
```bash
cat /Users/olliegilbey/code/resumate/.logs/rust-tests.log     # View Rust test output
cat /Users/olliegilbey/code/resumate/.logs/ts-tests.log       # View TypeScript test output
```

---

## Verification

**Last Generated:** 2025-11-27T16:42
**Next Update:** Automatically on next `just test` run
**Logs Valid For:** Current session (stored in /tmp)

**To verify counts:**
```bash
# Check Rust
grep "test result: ok" /Users/olliegilbey/code/resumate/.logs/rust-tests.log | grep -oE "[0-9]+ passed"

# Check TypeScript
grep "Tests.*passed" /Users/olliegilbey/code/resumate/.logs/ts-tests.log
```
